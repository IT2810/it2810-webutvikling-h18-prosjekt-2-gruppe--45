  "body": "The other two, slight air and purging fire,\nAre both with thee, wherever I abide;\nThe first my thought, the other my desire,\nThese present-absent with swift motion slide.\nFor when these quicker elements are gone\nIn tender embassy of love to thee,\nMy life, being made of four, with two alone\nSinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy;\nUntil life's composition be recured\nBy those swift messengers return'd from thee,\nWho even but now come back again, assured\nOf thy fair health, recounting it to me:\n  This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,\n   I send them back again and straight grow sad.",
